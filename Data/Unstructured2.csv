In football , the team that I am in favor of is Liverpool internationally then nationally I support Orlando Pirates. Ok can I hear from you . I don't want to lie , I doubt there's a sport I support but if I would be asked which sport I love  not that much I would say it's a netball because what I love about netball is that it isn't Gender based , like it is not biased. Can I hear from you brother. I am a fan & also a player. The sport that I play is rear but I watch football most of the time. I participate in football & I love it. I last played it in High School . I never played it here in UCT besides playing for fun as gents in our residences otherwise I don't participate. I used to play netball , I was chased away, why did they chase you away ?I don't want to explain it  because I might appear in news. Ok. I was chased away my position was being a centre  because I am short. What happened is that they didn't give a chance , they didn't pass the ball to me so when they decided to pass it to me I would run with it since I didn't know much about the rules & score by myself , I wouldn't even score a goal then they would be angry with me and they  chased me away. They said I should try out football , I will be good. I didn't play soccer, I grew up playing it but since academics take a lot of my time other than that I still love sport. I can kick the ball but I am not skilled. I was chased because i played wrongly all the time and I decided that it was a last team to chase me then quited without even trying other sports after I was chased by that team. They made me lose interest in sport. In football I love Cristiano Ronaldo, we refer to our G.O.A.T as  Greatest of all times. Other players love Messi , they force things Messi is not a G.O.A.T, it's Cristiano Ronaldo & he forever be my idol because  he does everything a football player do. He is a full package player . Why didn't you mention Neymar ? Do you love Neymar ? I love him. No Neymar is on his level , now we're talking about G.O.A.T like greatest of all times. I understand what a G.O.A.T i s but Neymar is also on that level. That's your opinion , that's how you see him. Don't judge me just because I was chased & think I know nothing about football. I agree with on that when you say Cristiano Ronaldo is the best football player internationally. Messi will never take Ronaldo's leading place. They say you can lead but it is not that you are the best of them all , I say Neymar is not a leader but he's got himself a great talent but people do not see that. I agree with you on that view but I think girls go for beauty when it comes to Neymar. No it's not about beauty but you must not play football knowing that you're not good looking. what about the talent then ? No Iam kidding it goes with talent. I don't criticise Messi but he must not be compared to Ronaldo because he is not in Ronaldo's level. In people's views more especially Messi's followers would not agree with you on that because that is your opinion and they have their. Neymar in his matches, he achieves but he must not be put on Ronaldo's  level. Ronaldo can run. All I would say I not a football person. The player I love that plays the sport I play is named Litombo, he plays chinesse sport. He won National awards  once after playing for six years and diagnosed with cancer. That didn't sit well with me. How would you feel if your favourite player would lose their jobs because of diseases ?I won't lie I would be saddened.","NGNABU002"
