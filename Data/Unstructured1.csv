Speaker 2: Man United    Speaker 1: let's be real, let's stop being fans and just looking at soccer, which team will win the premier league this season? Which one do you think? Obviously it is going to be Man City, but which one do you think will be in the top four?    Speaker 2: Top four: Man City, Man United, Arsenal for sure...     Speaker 1 : Well looking at players who play it makes sense to say it's Arsenal and Man City then the other two teams it has to be Chelsea. Also looking at the signings for me it makes sense for Chelsea to do better than Man United. Chelsea has better players than Man United.            Speaker 2: Telling the truth, it's still early to say.    Speaker 1: Looking at the signings and other things which one is the better team?  me, I can say 100% Chelsea is better than Man United.     Speaker 2: I hear you but you must also think last season Chelsea signed a lot of good players and we were expecting Chelsea to win the league, Enzo for example is a world cup winner.   Speaker 1: For me watching last season I could see Chelsea can never win based on team chemistry which was lacking, the players did not click.  Speaker 2: So you are saying Man United had better chemistry than Chelsea last season?     Speaker 1: I feel like 80% of the teams had better player chemistry than Chelsea. Because the squad is made up of 40 people. how can you feed 11 players out of 40? that does not make sense. Obviously the players were good. But for me this season I go with Newcastle, Chelsea... Speaker 2: Newcastle?  Speaker 1: Newcastle. If you look at the way Newcastle plays, it can beat any team in that league. They won 5 goals to 1 this past weekend.  The only shaky team yesterday was Manchester United.  Speaker 2: No I give that to you, they messed up yesterday.  Speaker 1: I'm happy they took Mount from chelsea my team.  Speaker 2: mount is a flop. this other chance that Mount was given, he wanted to kick it but just bumped it with the leg. I was like come on.    Speaker 1: the guy is not what he thought he was.  Speaker 2: Speaking the truth he does not deserve jersey number 7.    Speaker 1: ","NTWLEL001"

The international club I support is Liverpool. Local clubs from the PSL I support Orlando Pirates; the Bucaneers. can you tell me.    Speaker 2: i do not want to lie I do not think there is a sport I support, but the sport I like is netball because it is played by both genders women and men so it's not biased.   Speaker 3: I am a watcher and also play pigments it is a rare sport, i play at UCT. And I watch football mainly .   Speaker 1: I participate in football and last played professionally in high school.   Speaker 2: I was playing netball and was kicked ou. they gave me center position because I am short, my teammates never gavem me the ball and I was not aware of the rules. When I got the ball I used to run with it to go shoot and missed. they kicked me out saying I should try soccer.  Speaker 1: i grew up being known I play soccer but school took a lot of my time so i decided to focus on my books, but I still love soccer.   Speaker 3: With football I can kick but cannot dribble.  Speaker 2: With me I was not playing the right way and decided to give up and not play any sports because they broke my spirit by kicking me out like that when I was trying.   Speaker 1: In football I love Christiano Ronaldo we say he is the Greatest of all time. Some say it is Messi. Me I disagree Messi is not the greatest of all time but Ronaldo is. Ronaldo is complete and great in every aspect when it comes to football hence he is the greatest of all time.  Speaker 2: Why did you not mention Neymar?  Speaker 1: Neymar is on his level, but talking of GOATS he is not one. Speaker 2: i do not know what a GOAT is but Neymar is one.  Speaker 3: i agreee with you saying Ronaldo is the greatest, in Europe he was leading the pack. Even now he leads the Saudi Arabia. Messi having a world cup does not mean anything.   Speaker 2: they say you may be the best in some area but does not mean you are the best. I say Neymar is great because talent is visible in him.   Speaker 1: You are right but girls favour Neymar because of his looks.   Speaker 2: But come on do not play soccer knowing your looks are not the best. I am playing, it goes with talent.    Speaker 3: Messi si great yes but he must not be compared to Ronaldo because he is not near his level.   Speaker 2: Anyways if Messi's followers were here they would say a different thing that means if you love someon it does not mean they are the greatest in the world. Say he is number one to you, in your opinion.   Speaker 1: Neymar is good but is not on Ronaldo's level.  Speaker 2:   Ronaldo is fast I like that about him.     Speaker 1: Messi is not fast.    Speaker 3:  As someone who does not play football my favourite player in the sport I play is Ling Chuen, it's a chinese sport. He won world cups four times after playing six times after having cancer that troubled me.   Speaker 1: How would you feel your favourite player got unemployed due to being sick. Speaker 3: that would be so hurtful. Speaker 2: Even though we would be hurt we must remember all the things they had done and use them to remember him.  Speaker 3: Yes things that will live on.    Speaker 2: me a moment in football that interested me is the world cup .. this other player who looks good and played in the final? Speaker 3? Mbappe? Speaker 2: Yes, Mbappe! Speaker 3: Mbappe played a great game, the final he showed himself that he is becoming great and will be on ronaldo's level.  Speaker 1: No Mbappe can play.  Speaker 2: i love that one, Mbappe.  Speaker 1: how do you feel Messi won the world cup not your favourite pkayers?  Speaker 3: I think that goes with how many people are good in the team, for example Ronaldo he was the only great one in his team. Messi won because he was playing along with other great players.","NTWLEL001"

Speaker 2: I am good, how are you?    Speaker 1: I am also good, which sports do you like?   Speaker 2: Sports? I like football and basketball. What about you?   Speaker 1: I do not know.   Speaker 2: You do not play even one?   Speaker 1: I do not play, I have never played any sports in my life.  Speaker 2: Seriously?  Speaker 1: yes, you know in schools you play because you are perfect, you need to be able to play so I never stood a chance..    Speaker 2: Now that you are old have you ever thought of joining any sports like here in UCT?  Speaker 1: I do think about it sometimes, like basketball it seems interesting to me. Speaker 2: I play basketball where I stay, I enjoy playing it and I once played in primary too, competing in other places.  Speaker 1: How was it when you first started?  Speaker 2: It is a sport with many rules, you need to know the rules before you play, and you can never know all them it's many. But I do not play for any team because my degree is too busy I do not have the time.    Speaker 1: Do you not play football?  Speaker 2: No not often as I'd like because there are lack of grounds here, grounds are always full so you cannot have the chance to play in there. You should also think about it, sport helps clear your mind from books and all.   Speaker 1: For things like that I hike, the reason I do not play I think it is because I fear people.   Speaker 2: Which places have you hiked before>  Speaker 1: I have hiked Lions head four times.   Speaker 2: How was it?  Speaker 1: It was good, the breeze is cool, when you hike in the morning it is the best cause you see the sunrise, see the ocean in some part.   Speaker 2: Same I like it in the morning, have you ever thought of hiking Table Mountain?   Speaker 1: No I have not.   Speaker 2: I have hiked Table Mountain about two times I like it.   Speaker 1: I have not but have hiked Newlands though it did not feel like a hike, felt like I was walking.  Speaker 2: What do you think about netball?  Speaker 1: Netball I am used to it when we play in the community, but I cannot run so I would not be able to play it like professionally. Speaker 2: So you do it just to spend time?  Speaker 1: Yes when I was growing up I used to play chess and table tennis, is table tennis considered a sport?   Speaker 2: i do not know but with sport it goes with using your head so it would be a sport. How good are you in Chess?  Speaker 1: I last played in Grade 6, now I play just randomly with other people who can.   Speaker 2: Which sports do you think are not common? For example there is a sport called football which is not soccer, would you play that football.  Speaker 1: Any sports with running I would not do it, I get tired easily. Another sport I once played which people would not think is not a sport is gymnastics. I do not think I am as flexible anymore.   Speaker 2: What are your most memorable moments with regards to sports?   Speaker 1: You know when you are playing and you have your supporters cheering and singing for you, that is nice.    Speaker 2: You also feel good when they call out your name, like you feel like yeah I am good.   Is there any role model in sport you admire? Like Caster Semenya who is the bigges athlete.   Speaker 1: I like Caster Semenya, she brought a difference and fought stereotypes. You know how sports are mainly for men now when women excel in sports there are questions, I like that Caster was resilient throughout.   Speaker 2:  I agree with you, I remember people questioned her gender saying they do not think she is a woman which translates into saying people do not believe woman can be as capable. She is really great and she motivates me","NTWLEL001"

Soyiqala ngaphi into yokutya? Sizothi itheni? Okay, sosukohlala kwires yalapha eUCT? Yoh yoh yoh suthetha ngalonto yoh, yeses ebomini bam. Wawuhlala kweyiphi ires? EKopano. Kwakumnandi kodwa ukutya kwakhona yeses. Ndamkiswa phaya kukutya. Yazi xakufikwa bapheka better, bayakuzama. Awukuqhelanga nokukutya. Yazi mna yayiyinto efana nokuba ndihleli ehostel. Ukutya velevele ehostel kwakungekho mnandi xasithetha inyani but ukufika kwam apha it was an upgrade compared to hostel.  Yah mna compared to endiqhela ukuyitya ekhaya no.  Yah yah you can’t compare nakowenu kaloku. Yoh ndandikhala everyday. Ngoku kuyabuzwa “imali uyicelela ntoni kodwa kubhatalwa imali yokuba mawutye . Ndithi awu-andastendi wena. Usually kubekho itshikhini emini, itshikhini ebusuku. Ndiqonde intliziyo yam ibuhlungu kanjani. Inoba mna nyani yayiyintoba ndisuka ehostela ndikhomperisha from lento. Otherwise comparing to endlini ifull meal iqondile.  I was telling people uba yekse, I’d rather eat umphokoqo than ukutya kwalapha eUCT. EUCT they don’t mind ukukunika irice nechicken ibekwe on top. Uyinikwe ipleyni olohlobo, akukhososi. Akukho nento onoyifaka ngaphezulu ,iphelele apha. It’s up to you uba uzawuthini. Ukutya kwalapha nyani nyani hayi. Sometimes I feel like they don’t care, bayenza qha.  Ndandikhalaza komnye umama endimaziyo. Ndimazi from back. Wayeyitshomi neoledi. Uthi apha it’s not like upheka ukutya okwaziyo okumnandi. Unikwa izpice omawuzisebenzise, uba mawupheke ntoni, njani. Awuzukwazi ukuba uze nokutya kwamaxhosa ube uphekela nabanye because iicultures azufani.  Ikhona idiet abayifolowishayo because I remember ehostel sheym. As much as ukutya kwakungekho mnandi but because they follow idiet. Umzekelo ekseni we would eat ioats yabo? For ukuqinisa amathambo, protein , whatever. Mhlawumbi bakunike ioats, bakunike amaqanda, ithowusti and then emini they have into ezabaneekhabz, vejizi, whatever. But nditsho nje itaste? Nantso iproblem. It’s about itaste. I don’t care uba ukutya kunjani. Ndandiye kwideythi nomnye omntana. Eodarishe eziweyi zibizayo. Leweyi lena imbi. Sosuka ukuzitya ezaweyi?  Zimbi ezaweyi. Ukhe ubone xa ukhupha abantwana baseSandton wena ungahlali khona? Ube utya nabo and awufuni kuthini?  Ezawey I don’t think uba imnandi. Bayenzela iiaesthetics.  Ayikhomnandi. Awunondixelela uba ifishi ekrwada elayitwe phambi kwakho ngomlilo imnandi. Omnye umntana eodarishe wzawey zinintsi ndathatha one nakhona ndibambe umphefumla uba mayehle lento. Andfuni kuyava uba itasta kanjani. Andifuni kujampisa. Ndamxelela same time ukuba hekse asoze ndiphinde nditye ezizinto mna. Mna for idate I don’t want to lie iwey yokutya, yes we can eat but I feel like that’s not a date. Ayiyodate eyo. It must be something that we are both enjoying. Nam endizawuthi xasohlukene ndingazisoli uba yoh hayi lomntana oko ndandiyomtyisa ndispenda imali. Akukho nix endayenza naye. The problem kuxakufuneka ndibhatale idate ndiphinde ndibhatale neyokutya. Ucinga kabini. Uba sizakutya siphinde sense iiactivities imali ayivumi.  If uzoyokwenza iactivity ubuye ngoMacDonalds imali izawuvuka.  Iyavuma olohlobo but most of the time if uya eseapoint iirestyurenti azivalwa, zivule i24 hours. Zivalwa ngoo12. Uzothi uphuma pha ibe ivulile iBobo’s uyayicinga lento? Kodwa kenawe xa ukhupha itsheri kwidate usithi masiyotya awuvele nje umzekelo udibane netsheri apha ekhempasini you want to go out nalentombazana awuveli uthi gqi sowusithi Bobo’s uzoqale uthi ice cream eMac Donald’s sithathe iwalk uqale umbone uba ngumntu onjani. Ubone uba lo ofuna ukuzondityela imali. Leyo into ndiyayibona neh? Kodwa xa uye umbona umntu uba ekse lomntu, uyambona ukuba icontent yakhe ayizulunga kulento uyicingayo. So awuzukwazi ukufika umntu enestandard esilapha wena ufune ukumhlisa , uyamqhela. Kukumqhela kakubi oko. Ndiyaunderstanda umjita funeka abenemali yokumaintainer ubomi bakhe. Just because sowufikile akufunekanga wehlise istandard sakhe. Lomntana ebeqhela ukuzisa out every 2 weeks. Wena ufuna ukufika umse kwiirestyurenti ezincinci because you can’t afford. At the same time awufuni abhatale ngemali yakhe ngoba uzobona ingathi uwikhi. Ufuna ukumkhupha ngokukwakho kodwa awuzukwazi ukuyimaintainer. Lomntwana uphuma kwikhaya eligrand. Kodwa ke I think enye into ekufuneka siyithathe into consideration is indlela oze ngayo kulomntana. Uba uze ngostikha kuzofuneka uzenze ezazinto. Uba uze for fun akhoneed. Nantsi iproblem, ababantwana bahle apha eUCT awunovele uthi uze ngefun. Hayibo uzokuxelela uba ifun ngomzimba kabani? Nam ndiyaunderstanda why engazoyivuma. Kulula ukuzithetha ezawey xa itsheri ungayirespecti. Xawubona uba iweak. Xawubona uba lomntu umhle awunoveske uthi ndize… Kodwa ke nawe awunofika sowumnika ezangqondo zoba ndikubona as i10 or 7.  Kukhona amatsheri azaziyo uba angu10. Whatever omxelela yona akaqali ukuyiva. Noba umtreata as u6. If 100 other niggas bamtreata as u10 into oyithethayo akayiva. Ngamanye amaxesha izometharisha. Uyazi ngoba? Because you always stand out when you are different. Once ubedifferent athi amajita “hayi ndizakunika izulu nomhlaba” kwaze kwathini. Uthi wena.., But the thing is lamajita azomnika izulu nomhlaba anemoto ,ahlala kwiapartment eright. Uyintoni wena? Yintoni le uzanayo? Uza namasimba qha. Awunoveske uze uthi mna ndizakutyisa izinto ezinje. Andizukutyisa ntontoni. Unantoni kuqala? Kulula ukwenza izinto ezinjeya xa ungumntu onento. If uneR10 000 umxelele uba ndizkusa kwaMac Donald uyakwazi uba you can actually afford. Nazo izinto ezinzima ngalonto. Mna whatever I do, just stick to imeal endiyithandayo.  Yazi nyani ungabe usabe uzitsala. Funeka uthi uphuma ube uyijongile imenu. Uba uya eBobo’s funeka uyijonge online. But iproblem endingasoze ndiyenze kukuba utsheri iorderishe imeal yayo ibeyiR450 eyam izothi R300 ngemali yam. Hayi kaloku yimali yam le.  Yazi for ukutya imeal kwezazinto, uba uzokhupha itsheri mse kwezi3 course what what. Yabona pha? It’s structured . Noba ukhetha ntoni nantoni uyayazi uba ubhatala iR500. Umzekelo eHussel Grill, there is ispecial whereby ufumana your start, main course and dessert. Lameal yonke ayigqithanga kuR500. I’m not sure if its both of us okanye… If uyiqikelela kuR500 atleast istructured. Iproblem kukuba uyekwindawo where basically you have to spend uwhure . Umntu uyazidecidela uba ufuna okwenza malini. Enye ingxaki ziidrinks. Kumane kuaddwa enye emva kwenye. Yazi vele uzibambele ibhotile yewine. Ukhuphe iR160. Uyazi phaya uba kuzophuma noba ziiglasi eziy4. And if nawe ngumntwana okhuliswe kakuhle izobakhona into azoyifaka naye.  Eziwey ezininzi ezinxiba iiweave azikhuliswanga kakuhle. Umntu akayiboni ingxaki. ","GGXSAM001"
